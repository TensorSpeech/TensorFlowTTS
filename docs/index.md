This documentation web page aims to fully cover the end-to-end pipeline of using [TensorFlowTTS](https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorFlowTTS/) to train and deploy text-to-speech models. Since the original repository seems to be inactive, these set of tutorials will work on this [fork](https://github.com/w11wo/TensorFlowTTS/) developed by Wilson Wongso which contains new features.

## Newly Added Features

- [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet)-based Acoustic models for English and Indonesian
- [LightSpeech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04040)

## Guides

- [Installing TensorFlowTTS](./installation)
- Recipes
    - [LightSpeech & Multi-band MelGAN](./recipes/lightspeech-mbmelgan/intro)
    - Adding Custom Processor
- Inference/Deployment
    - Converting to TensorFlow Lite
    - Inference using TensorFlow Lite
